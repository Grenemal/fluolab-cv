excerpt: "<p style='text-align:justify'>Self-healing or self-repairing materials are ‘smart materials’ that repair damage caused by mechanical force and are a key development of 21st century materials chemistry and engineering. In this review we describe a few excellent examples of self-healing supramolecular polymers based on host-guest interactions and discuss their advantages and versatility.</p><img src='/images/GA/Publications-2014-COC.jpg' style='width: 400px; border-radius: 20px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"
